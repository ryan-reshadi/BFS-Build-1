      <h2>Federal Reserve & Monetary Policy</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Federal Reserve (the Fed)</strong> is the central bank of the United States, created by the <em>Federal Reserve Act of 1913</em>.</p>
      <h3>The Three Main Tools of Monetary Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Market Operations (OMO)</strong> — the most-used tool. The FOMC buys/sells government securities.
          <ul><li><b>Buy</b> securities → adds reserves → <b>expansionary</b> (rates fall, money supply rises)</li>
          <li><b>Sell</b> securities → drains reserves → <b>contractionary</b></li></ul></li>
        <li><strong>Discount Rate</strong> — rate the Fed charges banks at the discount window (Fed acts as <em>lender of last resort</em>).</li>
        <li><strong>Reserve Requirements</strong> — the % of deposits banks must hold. Lowering it expands lending.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Modern Implementation: Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)</h3>
      <p>In today's <em>ample-reserves</em> framework, the Fed primarily steers the <strong>federal funds rate</strong> by adjusting the interest it pays banks on reserves (IORB). This acts as a <b>floor</b>: a bank won't lend reserves to another bank for less than it can earn risk-free at the Fed.</p>
      <h3>Key Distinction: Monetary vs. Fiscal</h3>
      <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> = the Fed (money supply & interest rates). <strong>Fiscal policy</strong> = Congress + President (taxing & spending). This is a top national-level trap.</p>
      <h3>The Federal Funds Rate vs. Discount Rate</h3>
      <p>Fed funds rate = banks lending to <em>each other</em> overnight. Discount rate = Fed lending to <em>banks</em>.</p>
      <div class="explanation"><b>Finalist Tip:</b> Memorize policy DIRECTION. When growth is weak/inflation low → expansionary (buy bonds, cut rates). When inflation is high → contractionary (sell bonds, raise rates).</div>

        <li><strong>Board of Governors</strong> — 7 members, 14-year terms, based in Washington, D.C. The Chair serves a 4-year (renewable) term.</li>
        <li><strong>12 Regional Federal Reserve Banks</strong> — located in cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Atlanta. Each serves a district and supervises member banks.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</strong> — the policy-setting body with <b>12 voting members</b>: the 7 Governors + the New York Fed president (always votes) + 4 of the remaining 11 regional presidents (rotating annually).</li>

      <h2>Money Multiplier & Fractional Reserve Banking</h2>
      <p>Banks operate under <strong>fractional reserve banking</strong>: they hold only a fraction of deposits as reserves and lend the rest, expanding the money supply.</p>
      <h3>The Simple Money Multiplier</h3>
      <p class="formula">Money Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Requirement</p>
      <p>Maximum money-supply expansion = New Deposit × Money Multiplier.</p>
      <h3>Worked Example</h3>
      <p>Reserve requirement = 10%. New deposit = $1,000.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiplier = 1 / 0.10 = <b>10</b></li>
        <li>Total potential money supply increase = $1,000 × 10 = <b>$10,000</b></li>

      <h2>Interest Rate Mathematics</h2>
      <h3>APR vs. APY</h3>
      <p><strong>APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</strong> = the nominal/stated rate, ignoring compounding within the year.</p>
      <p><strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield)</strong> = the effective rate that accounts for compounding.</p>
      <p class="formula">APY = (1 + r/n)<sup>n</sup> − 1</p>
      <p>where r = nominal rate, n = compounding periods per year.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> 6% compounded monthly → APY = (1 + 0.06/12)<sup>12</sup> − 1 ≈ <b>6.17%</b>. APY ≥ APR always (equal only with annual compounding).</p>
      <h3>Real vs. Nominal Interest Rates</h3>
      <p class="formula">Real Rate ≈ Nominal Rate − Inflation Rate</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> 4% nominal − 6% inflation = <b>−2% real</b>. Negative real rate = losing purchasing power.</p>
      <h3>After-Tax vs. Tax-Equivalent Yield (don't confuse!)</h3>
      <p class="formula">After-Tax Yield = Taxable Yield × (1 − Tax Rate)</p>
      <p class="formula">Tax-Equivalent Yield = Tax-Free Yield / (1 − Tax Rate)</p>

      <h2>Loan Amortization</h2>
      <p>An <strong>amortizing loan</strong> is repaid with equal periodic payments split between interest and principal. Interest is charged on the <em>outstanding balance</em>, which declines over time.</p>
      <h3>The Key Insight: Interest Is Front-Loaded</h3>
      <p>Early payments are mostly <b>interest</b> (because the balance is highest). Later payments are mostly <b>principal</b>.</p>
      <p class="formula">Monthly Interest = Outstanding Balance × Monthly Rate</p>
      <p class="formula">Principal Portion = Total Payment − Interest Portion</p>
      <h3>Worked Example</h3>
      <p>$200,000 loan, 6% annual (0.5% monthly), payment = $1,199.10.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Month 1 interest = $200,000 × 0.005 = <b>$1,000</b></li>
        <li>Month 1 principal = $1,199.10 − $1,000 = <b>$199.10</b></li>
        <li>New balance = $199,800.90 (next month's interest is slightly lower)</li>

      <h2>Loan Pricing & Risk-Based Spreads</h2>
      <p>Banks price loans as a <strong>base rate + spread</strong>. The spread compensates for credit risk, term, and overhead.</p>
      <p class="formula">Loan Rate = Prime Rate + Risk Spread</p>
      <h3>Key Benchmark Rates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prime Rate</strong> — the rate banks charge their most creditworthy customers (typically Fed funds + ~3%).</li>
        <li><strong>SOFR</strong> (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) — replaced LIBOR as the leading benchmark for many floating-rate loans.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Risk-Based Pricing</h3>
      <p>Higher-risk borrowers receive larger spreads. Example: Prime (7.5%) + 2% = 9.5% for a strong borrower; Prime + 4% = 11.5% for a riskier one. Because they float with prime, both move when the Fed changes rates.</p>

      <h2>The Yield Curve as an Economic Signal</h2>
      <p>The yield curve plots Treasury yields across maturities (the <em>term structure</em> of interest rates).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Normal</strong> — slopes up; investors demand more for longer maturities.</li>
        <li><strong>Flat</strong> — uncertainty/transition.</li>
        <li><strong>Inverted</strong> — short rates exceed long rates; investors expect future rate cuts and slower growth. One of the most-watched <b>recession indicators</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="explanation"><b>Finalist Tip:</b> Inversion reflects market <em>expectations</em>, not a failure of the Fed. It signals risk over months, not guaranteed events.</div>
